\projectsubsection{Quadcopter Reinforcement Learning Agent}
{USC Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory}
{Working on building an Reinforcement Learning agent that is capable of
navigating quickly through a cluttered environment. Train the agent in
simulation, and transfer the learnt policy to a real-world quadcopter.
\textit{IN PROGRESS}}{}

\projectsubsection{Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data}
{Undergraduate Senior Thesis}
{Researched Deep Learning and implemented a long short-term memory
network that identifies if a given time-series sequence of a particular
time series system is anomalous or not. The dataset that I worked with
was provided by my faculty advisor which corresponds to the energy usage
of an electric meter on the circuit that provides power to the water
pump. After training, the network was able to identify anomalies with
an accuracy of 90\%.}{}

\projectsubsectionold{Who's Lazy? Not Eye}
{Hack UCSC 2017}
{A vision therapy program for people with lazy eye using a standard 
webcam. The app uses the webcam to constantly analyze the user's eyes 
and notifies them when their eyes drift away. Particularly, the client
can pause any media application that the user has playing in the 
background and will only let them resume their application once they 
have focused their eyes. I worked on the algorithm that located the
position of the pupils using machine learning and identified whether
the pupils correlated with lazy eyes or not based on that position.}

\projectsubsectionold{Othello (Reversi) for the PSoC 5LP}
{Final Project for the Microcontroller Syste Design Class (CMPE 121)}
{Implemented Othello using C and the Cypress API for the Othello PSoC 5LP.
It was built using all the different concepts learned in class. Refer to the
report in the documentation directory in the repository for more details.}

\projectsubsectionold{UCSC Plaza}
{Group Project for Software Engineering Class (CMPS 115)}
{UCSC Plaza is an event manager designed for members of UCSC. This is simply
a prototype. Worked with JavaScript and JQuery to make the interface which
connects the front-end to the web-server. Project was developed using Scrum
practices.}
{https://github.com/Skm1221/CMPS115TeamProject}

\projectsubsectionold{HummusLite}
{Personal Project on Logic Design}
{A simple project I worked on over Summer of 2016. Goal was to build a simple
CPU in Minecraft. The CPU supports 16 instructions and has a program data
size of 256 bytes. Each instruction is a byte. Programming for the CPU
requires using a punch board system that was also built from scratch in
Minecraft.}

\imgsection{hobbies}{Research Interests and Hobbies}
I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Particularly,
I want to focus on the field of Deep Learning and its application to
cyberphysical and social problems. I am also very interested in 
Deep Reinforcement Learning such as AlphaGo. My other hobbies include a variety
of things such as researching about Linux, Physics and Astronomy. I
also practice the Violin and can solve a variety of different rubik's
cubes.
